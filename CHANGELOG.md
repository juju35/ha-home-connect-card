# Changelog

## 1.11.6 - 2026-11-01
### Fixes
- Mini cards at their default size (half a section of a Sections view) are readable again: the appliance name no longer disappears and the power button no longer sticks out of the card. On a narrow card the round buttons move under the text, the finish time wraps instead of being cut, the status pill shows only its coloured dot and the state is written above the program instead. Below about 200 px the Home Connect logo steps aside. The full card's buttons, percentage and door chip wrap at that width too.
- The status pill no longer squeezes the appliance name: it takes at most half the header and shortens its text. The name now gives way first, so at ordinary widths the pill shows its whole label ("Ready" was cut to "Re…" on a 320 px card).
- Keyboard: the focused button keeps the focus after the card redraws, so pressing Enter on Stop and then Enter again confirms it, and Pause, Resume, the option pills and the power button no longer send the focus back to the top of the page. Giving the focus back never scrolls the page: after tapping Pause or the zoom button and scrolling away, the dashboard no longer jumps back to the card on every update (every 30 s during a program).
- Long states ("Wymagane działanie", "Niedostępne"), the program and the finish time wrap instead of ending in "…" on a narrow card, and a long option label wraps inside its pill instead of sticking out of the card.
- The card keeps a usable width in containers that size it from its content (layout-card, button-card, an `auto` grid column) instead of shrinking to its padding, and it still shrinks to fit two per row in a grid card, layout-card `1fr 1fr` grid or horizontal stack instead of overflowing it, including when the dashboard wraps each card in its own element.
- Screen readers announce whether an option pill or the power button is on or off.
- Better contrast: the door, salt and rinse aid warnings, the state texts, error messages and the blue/red button labels are now readable on light and dark themes (at least 4.5:1). The delayed start purple follows the theme (`--purple-color`) and is no longer too dark on a dark card.

### Maintenance
- Screenshots: a capture is only rewritten when its pixels change, so a re-render that looks the same no longer shows up in the screenshots commit.

## 1.11.5 - 2026-11-01
### Changes
- Added Italian, Dutch, European Portuguese and Polish translations: `it`, `nl`, `pt` and `pl`, for the cards and the visual editor, whose language picker offers Italiano, Nederlands, Português (Portugal) and Polski. Home Assistant in `pt-BR` gets the European Portuguese texts.

## 1.11.4 - 2026-11-01
### Changes
- Added Serbian (Cyrillic and Latin) translations: `sr` and `sr-Latn`, for the cards and the visual editor, whose language picker offers Српски and Srpski (latinica). With Home Assistant in `sr-Latn` the card picks the Latin script automatically.

## 1.11.3 - 2026-10-29
### Fixes
- Masonry dashboards balance their columns better: the card now reports its real height (from 3 to about 8 rows depending on the program picker, options and buttons shown) instead of a fixed size.
- Every button (Pause, option pills, power, Load options) now reacts when hovered and shows a clear focus ring when reached with the keyboard.

### Maintenance
- Screenshots: the animated GIFs are now identical from one run to the next (the card's animations were not paused while recording), so pull requests no longer get a needless screenshots commit.
- CI: Dependabot also updates the pre-commit hooks, and the Biome lint job reads its version from `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

## 1.11.2 - 2026-10-29
### Fixes
- Leaving the view right after tapping Stop no longer leaves the button armed: back on the view it shows Stop again, so a single tap can't stop the program. An error message no longer stays on screen either.
- On touch screens, closing a drop-down without picking anything no longer freezes the progress, state and finish time until the next tap elsewhere.

## 1.11.1 - 2026-10-29
### Fixes
- An option switch whose entity id ends in `_etat` is no longer mistaken for the power switch (it stays in the options).
- Renaming the appliance or switching Home Assistant between 12 h and 24 h now updates the card right away.
- Translations: the Spanish power button reads "Encendido/apagado", the German delayed-start badge is shorter ("Verzögerter Start") so the mini card keeps room for the appliance name, and the German editor uses Home Assistant's "Konnektivität".

### Maintenance
- CI: screenshots checkout no longer falls back to a ref fork PRs cannot resolve; the Chromium download is time-boxed and retried, and the browser deps step fails explicitly after three failed attempts.
- CI: after pushing refreshed screenshots to a pull request, the Screenshots workflow re-runs Lint, Validate and HACS on that commit (via `workflow_dispatch`, which a `GITHUB_TOKEN` push can trigger); Lint gains a `workflow_dispatch` trigger.

## 1.11.0 - 2026-10-28
### Changes
- Spanish translation (cards and visual editor); the editor's language picker offers Español.

## 1.10.0 - 2026-10-28
### Changes
- German translation (cards and visual editor), contributed by domwu0001.

## 1.9.0 - 2026-10-28
### Changes
- Option toggles / selects, Pause, Resume, Stop and the program select now retry and show their errors in the card (like Start) instead of Home Assistant's toast.
- The finish time follows the Home Assistant locale's 12 h / 24 h preference.
- Faster updates: entity role matching and appliance detection are cached instead of being recomputed on every state change in Home Assistant.

### Fixes
- The visual editor's Appliance field shows its label and helper instead of the raw `ed_device_id` key.
- A focused drop-down no longer freezes the card's updates until a click elsewhere: Escape or leaving the card releases it.

### Maintenance
- README: new GIFs of the running, paused, delayed-start and finished animations for both appliances; all screenshots regenerated.
- CI: fork-safe screenshots workflow, release gated on the tests, Dependabot also watches npm.

## 1.8.0 - 2026-10-26
### Changes
- The mini card's progress bar is now built with a template literal instead of string concatenation, matching the rest of the file. No change to the rendered output or behavior.

## 1.7.0 - 2026-10-26
### Changes
- The Options section title has a leading 16px icon, like the other cards' section titles.
- Start / Resume buttons (and the mini card's round play button) are tinted with the primary color instead of filled; Stop keeps its error tint, and its confirm step is a stronger tint with a ring instead of a solid red fill.
- Header geometry: the body starts 8 px under the header (was 10 px); logo 12 px from the card's top and left edges, power / detail button at the right edge as before.

## 1.6.4 - 2026-10-25

### Changes
- Door open: the washer shows its porthole swung open on the empty drum, the dishwasher its lowered door on the loaded racks.

## 1.6.3 - 2026-10-25

### Changes
- Reverted the read-only options shown while a program runs (1.6.2): Home Connect doesn't expose them once a program has started.

## 1.6.2 - 2026-10-25

### Changes
- While a program runs, the options in use are listed read-only (temperature, spin speed… and the switched-on extras); the mini card adds them after the program name.

## 1.6.1 - 2026-10-25

### Fixes
- The illustration, default name and subtitle follow the appliance's own programs: a washing machine shown with the dishwasher card type now gets the washer illustration and its animations.

## 1.6.0 - 2026-10-25

### Changes
- New mini cards `home-connect-dishwasher-mini-card` and `home-connect-washer-mini-card`, like the Roborock mini card: appliance, state, program, progress, alerts and round buttons; the detail button (`zoom`, on by default) unfolds the full card and a click elsewhere folds it back.
- New header like the Roborock card: Home Connect logo on the left (links to home-connect.com, hide it with `show_logo: false`), program as subtitle.
- Appliance illustration next to the state: while a program runs, the washer shakes, its drum tumbles the laundry and bubbles rise, and the dishwasher steams, sprays and lights the floor; the display blinks. A badge marks a paused appliance (pause, breathing), a delayed start (turning clock) and a finished program (check mark drawn in, with sparkles); no animation with reduced motion; the display takes the state color. Progress now shows as a large percentage with the state and finish time. Setting `icon` puts the icon back instead of the illustration.
- New `show_power` option (default `true`, also in the visual editor) to hide the power button, e.g. for a washing machine that can't be turned on / off remotely.

## 1.5.3 - 2026-10-25

### Fixes
- **Start** no longer fails on a momentary refusal from the appliance (`BadRequest`, `WrongOperationState`): the card retries once after 3 seconds, with a disabled "Starting…" button meanwhile. If it still fails, a short translated message shows in the card (technical detail in its tooltip) instead of Home Assistant's raw error; it goes away on the next state change or after 10 seconds.
- While a program is being set on the appliance itself (*Remote control* off), the options section says so and **Load options** is disabled until remote control is back; the card never reloads the options by itself. A failed reload shows a message in the card and the original program is always restored.
- An appliance that refuses to be turned off gets a message in the card instead of a raw error, and its power button stays disabled while it's on; turning it on still works.

### Changes
- New `remote_control` entity override (auto-detected, documented in the README and offered in the editor).

## 1.5.2 - 2026-10-25

### Maintenance
- Lint warnings on the editor and card-picker lookups silenced so an automatic Biome fix cannot give the washer card the dishwasher profile again; duplication checks run on Node 22. Nothing changes for users.

## 1.5.1 - 2026-10-24

### Maintenance
- Deterministic screenshots (fixed clock and time zone), each rendered in a fresh page; duplication checks no longer scan the tests. Nothing changes for users.

## 1.5.0 - 2026-10-24

### Changes
- The visual editor follows the card's `language` option.
- `connectivity`, `salt` and `rinse_aid` entity overrides documented in the README and offered in the editor (salt and rinse aid on the dishwasher card only).

### Fixes
- A washer card added from the card picker gets a washer instead of the first dishwasher, and its editor keeps the `pause` / `resume` overrides.
- The Pause button shows from the start: a button entity never pressed yet (`unknown`) no longer hides it; it still hides when `unavailable`.
- The 30 s refresh only redraws the card while a program with a finish time runs, instead of rebuilding it every 30 s when idle.
- Lighter updates: the appliance's entities are no longer looked up in the whole entity registry on every Home Assistant update.
- The status text and the config values (icon, entity ids) are HTML-escaped.

### Maintenance
- CI hardening: actions pinned by commit SHA, read-only workflow token, monthly Dependabot updates, duplication findings annotated in pull requests.
- Unit tests (`npm test`) run in CI; `package-lock.json` version synced. Nothing changes for users.

## 1.4.1 - 2026-10-22

### Maintenance
- Tooling only, no functional change: Biome linting, pre-commit and a Lint CI (duplication checks). Card source modernized (optional chaining, template literals), identical behavior.

## 1.4.0 - 2026-10-22

### Changes
- More compact layout with the same information, like the other ha-* cards: 12 px card padding, 36 px header icon, 16 px name and 12 px subtitle, 11 px pills, tighter tiles and sections.
- Appliance icon and power button 40 → 36 px, lower program selector, options and buttons, 4 px progress bar.

## 1.3.3 - 2026-10-21

### Changes
- HACS now asks for Home Assistant 2024.8 or later, the version that brought the sections view the card supports; the README says so under **Prerequisites**.

## 1.3.2 - 2026-10-21

### Maintenance
- Merged branches are deleted automatically (new `cleanup-branches` workflow). Nothing changes for users.

## 1.3.1 - 2026-10-21

### Development
- The built card is no longer committed in `dist/`: CI builds it on every push, and the release workflow builds it and attaches it to the release, which is where HACS downloads it from. Nothing changes for users.

## 1.3.0 - 2026-10-21

### Changes
- State colors come from the Home Assistant theme (`--info-color` running, `--warning-color` paused or action required, `--success-color` finished, `--error-color` error) with the Home Assistant defaults as fallbacks; the Stop button and the open-door chip follow them too.
- Header aligned with the other ha-* cards: 40px badge, name 18px.
- Chips, toggles, fields and the progress bar use the shared sizes and radii (12px pills, 10px fields, 6px bar).

### Development
- The card source moves to `src/home-connect-card.js`; `npm run build` stamps the version from `package.json` into `dist/home-connect-card.js`, and CI checks that `dist/` is up to date.
- `npm run screenshots` renders the README screenshots with mock Home Connect devices.
- Releases are published when `version` in `package.json` has no tag yet.

## 1.2.0 - 2026-10-20

### What's new
- Home Connect logo next to the appliance name.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-10-19

### Fixes
- Program options (intensive zone, brilliance dry, speed perfect, hygiene plus…) no longer disappear when Home Connect hasn't loaded them: they stay visible, greyed out, until they're available.

### What's new
- **Load options** button when no option is loaded yet, for example after a Home Assistant restart. It switches to another program and back, which makes Home Connect send the options.
- New README screenshot of the dishwasher with its program options.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-10-18

First public release.

### What's new
- Two cards for the Home Connect integration: `home-connect-dishwasher-card` and `home-connect-washer-card`.
- Pick the appliance once: every entity (state, door, progress, finish time, programs, power, stop/pause/resume, alerts) is found automatically from the device, and any of them can be overridden.
- Status with color, progress bar, finish time and time left while a program runs.
- Program picker and Start button (when remote start is enabled on the appliance), Pause/Resume for washers, Stop with a confirmation tap.
- Program options before starting: temperature, spin speed, Vario Perfect, intensive zone, hygiene and so on, whatever the appliance exposes.
- Door state, salt and rinse aid alerts.
- Visual editor in the dashboard UI, labels in English and French.
- Light and dark theme compatible, installable via HACS.
